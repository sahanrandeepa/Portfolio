                <p>
                    I'm Sahan Randeepa, currently pursuing a computer science degree at the Informatics Institute of Technology, 
                    in partnership with the University of Westminster. My journey in technology began at a young age, with a 
                    keen interest in programming and solving real-world challenges through software.

                <p>
                    I attended Rahula College-Matara, where I completed both my OLs and ALs with flying colors. This solid foundation in 
                    academics prepared me well for the challenges of university studies and inspired my career path in technology.
